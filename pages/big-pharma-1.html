        <h2 class="underline">The Broken System</h2>
        <p>Our example will show a pharmacist named Howard Jacobson. Howard and most pharmacists around sell a drug
            named Metaphormin, a cheap drug used to treat type two diabetes. The drug costs Howard $1.61 and if the
            patient pays out of pocket for the drug, he would sell it for $4.00. He makes a repectable $2.39 in profits.
            The patient gets their medicine, the pharmacist gets their profit and the drug manufacturors get their cut
            as well. That is unless the patient paid with their insurance. Then the patient would have to pay $10.84 for
            the same drug and the pharmacist would lose profits and only make $1.93 from the drug. Where does the other
            $7.30 go you might be wondering. That money goes directly to the insurance companies. The pharmacist should
            have just told the patient to pay in cash to get it cheaper right? Well up until recently, the pharmacist
            couldn't because they were under contract with the insurance companies to keep them quiet. Also known as
            'gag clauses'.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">The Markup</h2>
        <p>Now you may think that paying $10 instead of $4 is not that big of a deal for most people. But when you start
            getting into drugs to treat terminal or rare diseases, where these kinds of drugs costs US consumers around
            three million dollars on average. These markups can get rather deadly.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">The Game of Big Pharma</h2>
        <p>Now if this isn't making much sense to you, good! That's because it shouldn't, that the interesting part of
            the world of big pharma. A very lucrative racket. Although it's not all to lucrative for the patients, or
            the pharmacies, or the drug-makers. The real winners of this racket are the insurance companies.</p>
